- 👋 Hi, I’m @michelson-code (Bruno Michelson)

- 👀 I’m interested in geophysical data analysis, petrophysics, seismic processing, and energy exploration

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in well log interpretation using Python and Interactive Petrophysics

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research and applied projects in E&P, petrophysics, and open geophysical datasets

- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn | bruno.michelson.121@ufrn.edu.br

- ⚡ Fun fact: I built a sustainable seismograph prototype during my undergrad and love connecting code with real-world geoscience problems
